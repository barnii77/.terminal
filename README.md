# Overview
This is simply a github repo containing my terminal config because by now, I have changed quite a lot and some of it is related to my lunarvim config. Thus, I uploaded it to github now so I can easily clone it and, of course, excluded my openai api key. If you want to use my terminal setup, you have to clone this repo to ~/.terminal and add to your .bash_profile (or .profile if none exists) the line `. "$HOME/.terminal/profile`. If you want to also have an openai api key, you can add a .bash_openai_api_key file containing the line `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"` to the ~/.terminal directory.
